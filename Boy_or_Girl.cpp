/*Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.

Input
The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters â€” the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.

Output
If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).*/

    // in the loop below we are counting no of duplicate elements
    // Count the frequency of each character
    for (char ch : s)
    {
        charFrequency[ch - 'a']++; // Certainly, let me explain that line for you.In C++, characters are represented using ASCII values. The ASCII value of the lowercase letter 'a' is 97. In the line `charFrequency[ch - 'a']++;`, it subtracts the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the character `ch`. This operation essentially converts the character to a zero-based index, which is helpful when working with arrays.For example, let's say `ch` is 'c'. The ASCII value of 'c' is 99. So, `ch - 'a'` would be `99 - 97`, which is 2. This means that the frequency of the character 'c' is updated in the `charFrequency` array at index 2.In summary, this line is a way to convert characters to an index suitable for array indexing, where 'a' corresponds to index 0, 'b' corresponds to index 1, and so on. This is a common technique when dealing with character frequencies or counting occurrences of characters in a string using an array.
